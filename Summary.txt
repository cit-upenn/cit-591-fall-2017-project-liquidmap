LiquidMaps is a Java application designed to create an artistic animated image of a city's roads. This is done by defining up to a thousand trips that are all pictorially represented at once.  We use a combination of image and text files to determine latitude and longitude locations.  These are fed to GraphHopper, an open-source routing engine.  Finally, the routes are converted into JavaScript code which can be rendered in an html file as an animated SVG.

Steven Brooks:
Primarily responsible for authoring the raster image input and vector data file parsing.

Brian Edwards:
Primarily responsible for interfacing with GraphHopper and converting the response into lat-lon-time triplets.

Matt Surka:
Primarily responsible for the JavaScript-authoring code.

All authors contributed to this project equally.
