# Liquid Map

This utilizes a JAR method of using GraphHopper.

Execute src/TestJarImport.java

First execution should take a minute while 'graphhopperWD' is created and populated.

I'm considering only

src/*
graphhopper-web-0.70-with-dep.jar
philadelphia.osm.pbf
README.md

as part of this project.  I don't think we should upload other files to Github.
